we	B-X

This	B-X
paper	B-X
describes	B-X
a	B-X
controlled	B-X
way	B-X
to	B-X
immobilize	B-X
gold	B-X
nanoparticles	B-X
on	B-X
planar	B-X
gold	B-X
surfaces	B-X
and	B-X
the	B-X
use	B-X
of	B-X
the	B-X
resulting	B-X
3D	B-X
platform	B-X
to	B-X
build	B-X
up	B-X
a	B-X
3D	B-X
biosensor	B-X
.	B-X
The	B-X
surface	B-X
was	B-X
first	B-X
functionalized	B-X
by	B-X
grafting	B-X
hexanedithiol	B-X
,	B-X
this	B-X
molecule	B-X
has	B-X
2	B-X
thiol	B-X
end	B-X
groups	B-X
,	B-X
which	B-X
enables	B-X
its	B-X
chemical	B-X
grafting	B-X
to	B-X
planar	B-X
gold	B-X
while	B-X
retaining	B-X
a	B-X
free	B-X
thiol	B-X
group	B-X
to	B-X
attach	B-X
nanoparticles	B-X
.	B-X
This	B-X
step	B-X
was	B-X
optimized	B-X
by	B-X
varying	B-X
experimental	B-X
parameters	B-X
such	B-X
as	B-X
solvent	B-X
,	B-X
temperature	B-X
and	B-X
immersion	B-X
time	B-X
.	B-X
The	B-X
grafting	B-X
was	B-X
monitored	B-X
by	B-X
polarization	B-X
modulation	B-X
infrared	B-X

and	B-X

)	B-X
.	B-X
The	B-X
high	B-X
resolution	B-X
XPS	B-X
sulfur	B-X
peak	B-X
made	B-X
clear	B-X
the	B-X
existence	B-X
of	B-X
two	B-X
contributions	B-X
,	B-X
S	B-X
bound	B-X
to	B-X
gold	B-X
and	B-X
free	B-X
S	B-X
,	B-X
thus	B-X
led	B-X
us	B-X
to	B-X
determine	B-X
the	B-X
optimal	B-X
conditions	B-X
to	B-X
graft	B-X

were	B-X
then	B-X
immobilized	B-X
on	B-X
the	B-X
resulting	B-X
surface	B-X
and	B-X
their	B-X
presence	B-X
was	B-X
evidenced	B-X

The	B-X
resulting	B-X
gold	B-X

was	B-X
used	B-X
to	B-X
build	B-X
up	B-X

respectively	B-X

Each	B-X
step	B-X
was	B-X
characterized	B-X
by	B-X
PM-IRRAS	B-X
then	B-X
compared	B-X
to	B-X
the	B-X

Despite	B-X
