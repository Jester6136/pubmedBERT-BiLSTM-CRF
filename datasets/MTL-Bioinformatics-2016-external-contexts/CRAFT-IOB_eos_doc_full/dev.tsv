several	B-X
recent	B-X

indicated	B-X
that	B-X

that	B-X

We	B-X
also	B-X
found	B-X
that	B-X

Therefore	B-X

this	B-X

in	B-X
the	B-X
case	B-X
of	B-X
Myl.c	B-X

and	B-X
then	B-X
Tbx15/18/22	B-X
maintained	B-X
the	B-X

Myl.c	B-X
after	B-X

.	B-X
RNA-sequencing	B-X

Tbx15/18/22	B-X

Here	B-X

we	B-X
review	B-X
the	B-X

for	B-X

We	B-X
discuss	B-X
the	B-X

give	B-X
rise	B-X
to	B-X
the	B-X

This	B-X
suggests	B-X
the	B-X

This	B-X

'Incentive-Sensitization	B-X

The	B-X
theory	B-X
addresses	B-X
three	B-X
fundamental	B-X
questions	B-X
.	B-X
The	B-X
first	B-X
is	B-X
:	B-X
why	B-X
do	B-X
addicts	B-X
crave	B-X
drugs	B-X
?	B-X
That	B-X
is	B-X
,	B-X
what	B-X
is	B-X
the	B-X
psychological	B-X
and	B-X
neurobiological	B-X
basis	B-X
of	B-X
drug	B-X
craving	B-X
?	B-X
The	B-X
second	B-X
is	B-X
:	B-X
why	B-X
does	B-X
drug	B-X
craving	B-X
persist	B-X
even	B-X
after	B-X
long	B-X
periods	B-X
of	B-X
abstinence	B-X
?	B-X
The	B-X
third	B-X
is	B-X
whether	B-X
'wanting	B-X
'	B-X
drugs	B-X
(	B-X
drug	B-X
craving	B-X
)	B-X
is	B-X
attributable	B-X
to	B-X
'liking	B-X
'	B-X
drugs	B-X
(	B-X
to	B-X
the	B-X
subjective	B-X
pleasurable	B-X
effects	B-X
of	B-X
drugs	B-X
)	B-X
?	B-X
The	B-X

Incentive	B-X
salience	B-X
is	B-X
a	B-X
psychological	B-X
process	B-X
that	B-X
transforms	B-X
the	B-X
perception	B-X
of	B-X
stimuli	B-X
,	B-X
imbuing	B-X
them	B-X

In	B-X
some	B-X
individuals	B-X
the	B-X
repeated	B-X
use	B-X
of	B-X
addictive	B-X
drugs	B-X
produces	B-X
incremental	B-X
neuroadaptations	B-X
in	B-X
this	B-X
neural	B-X
system	B-X

that	B-X
transforms	B-X
ordinary	B-X
'wanting	B-X

into	B-X
excessive	B-X
drug	B-X

(	B-X

It	B-X
is	B-X
further	B-X
proposed	B-X
that	B-X

the	B-X
neural	B-X

which	B-X
may	B-X
be	B-X

Firstly	B-X

we	B-X
find	B-X
a	B-X

we	B-X

three-dimensional	B-X

we	B-X

appreciate	B-X
that	B-X
the	B-X

not	B-X

are	B-X
improving	B-X
very	B-X
fast	B-X

This	B-X
type	B-X
of	B-X

is	B-X
created	B-X
using	B-X
spherical	B-X

so	B-X
we	B-X

In	B-X

the	B-X

clarify	B-X

distinguish	B-X
among	B-X
the	B-X
three	B-X
ages	B-X
of	B-X

:	B-X
the	B-X

We	B-X
then	B-X

that	B-X
fossil-calibrated	B-X

Instead	B-X

we	B-X

this	B-X

almost	B-X
entirely	B-X

In	B-X
the	B-X

we	B-X
propose	B-X
that	B-X
the	B-X
age	B-X
of	B-X

is	B-X
best	B-X
described	B-X
as	B-X
