have	B-X

the	B-X

toxicity	B-X
of	B-X

to	B-X
humans	B-X
and	B-X
the	B-X

it	B-X

believed	B-X

the	B-X

are	B-X

determine	B-X
their	B-X

organisms	B-X
as	B-X

Thus	B-X

several	B-X
recent	B-X
studies	B-X
,	B-X
including	B-X
ours	B-X
,	B-X
pointed	B-X
out	B-X
that	B-X

cytotoxic	B-X

Meanwhile	B-X

few	B-X

that	B-X

could	B-X
also	B-X
be	B-X

We	B-X

This	B-X

The	B-X
second	B-X
is	B-X

does	B-X
drug	B-X
craving	B-X
persist	B-X
even	B-X
after	B-X
long	B-X
periods	B-X
of	B-X
abstinence	B-X
?	B-X
The	B-X
third	B-X
is	B-X
whether	B-X
'wanting	B-X
'	B-X
drugs	B-X
(	B-X
drug	B-X

note	B-X

be	B-X

we	B-X

The	B-X
results	B-X
can	B-X
be	B-X
interpreted	B-X
that	B-X
the	B-X
unique	B-X
structure	B-X

A	B-X
major	B-X
dilemma	B-X
facing	B-X
the	B-X
Myc	B-X

is	B-X
understanding	B-X
how	B-X
c-Myc	B-X
regulation	B-X
of	B-X
gene	B-X
transcription	B-X
translates	B-X
into	B-X
the	B-X

and	B-X
oncogenic	B-X
activities	B-X
mediated	B-X
by	B-X
c-Myc	B-X
protein	B-X
.	B-X
Indeed	B-X
,	B-X
much	B-X
effort	B-X
has	B-X
focused	B-X

attempting	B-X
to	B-X
link	B-X

Considerable	B-X
progress	B-X
has	B-X

with	B-X
the	B-X

is	B-X
now	B-X
evident	B-X
that	B-X
c-Myc	B-X
can	B-X
also	B-X
repress	B-X
the	B-X
transcription	B-X

specific	B-X
genes	B-X
,	B-X
and	B-X
Myc-mediated	B-X
repression	B-X
appears	B-X
to	B-X
be	B-X
linked	B-X
to	B-X
Myc-dependent	B-X
transformation	B-X
.	B-X
We	B-X
summarize	B-X
the	B-X
evidence	B-X
on	B-X
Myc	B-X
biological	B-X
and	B-X
molecular	B-X
functions	B-X
with	B-X

to	B-X
Myc-Max	B-X
transcriptional	B-X

direct	B-X
transactivation	B-X
of	B-X
cellular	B-X

the	B-X
growth-promoting	B-X

Here	B-X

we	B-X
first	B-X
clarify	B-X
and	B-X
distinguish	B-X
among	B-X
the	B-X
three	B-X
ages	B-X
of	B-X
angiosperms	B-X
:	B-X
the	B-X
age	B-X
of	B-X
their	B-X

with	B-X
acrogymnosperms	B-X

and	B-X
the	B-X
age	B-X
of	B-X
the	B-X
most	B-X
recent	B-X

all	B-X

living	B-X

We	B-X
then	B-X
demonstrate	B-X
,	B-X
based	B-X
on	B-X
recent	B-X
studies	B-X

that	B-X
fossil-calibrated	B-X

dating	B-X
estimates	B-X
of	B-X
the	B-X
crown-group	B-X
age	B-X

angiosperms	B-X
have	B-X
little	B-X
to	B-X
do	B-X
with	B-X
either	B-X
the	B-X
amount	B-X
of	B-X

or	B-X
the	B-X
number	B-X
of	B-X
internal	B-X
fossil	B-X
calibrations	B-X
included	B-X
.	B-X
Instead	B-X
,	B-X
we	B-X
argue	B-X
that	B-X
this	B-X
age	B-X
is	B-X
almost	B-X
entirely	B-X
conditioned	B-X
by	B-X
its	B-X
own	B-X

)	B-X
.	B-X
In	B-X
the	B-X
meantime	B-X
,	B-X
we	B-X
propose	B-X
that	B-X
the	B-X
age	B-X
of	B-X
angiosperms	B-X
is	B-X
best	B-X
described	B-X
as	B-X
largely	B-X
unknown	B-X

in	B-X
the	B-X
literature	B-X
mostly	B-X
reflect	B-X
conflicting	B-X

We	B-X
also	B-X
